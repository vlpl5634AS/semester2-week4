 * Use the series approxiation to Pi

 * to approximate Pi
 * and examine how accurate it is as 
 * you increase the number of terms, n.
 * Enter the number of terms, n,  as a command line argument.
 * ie. measure error = abs( Pi-pi_n )
 * Hint: math library function fabs(x) gives you the absolute value as a double. 
 * Print out the number of terms, the computed value pi_n and the error
