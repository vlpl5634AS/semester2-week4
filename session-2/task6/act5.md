# Implement programs in C and Python



There are 2 C tasks to complete.



**compute\_pi.c**

Extension task:

* if you consider the output for n=100 and n=200 can you predict how many terms are required to achieve and error = 0.0001?



**string\_search.c**

Extension task:

* what happens if you search for a character that is not in the string?
* can you explain why?



**Implementation in Python**

You should also implement solutions in Python to each task.

Compare your C and Python solutions in terms of:

* use of built-in libraries/modules
* simplicity



**Comments and documentation**

Remove the instructions from the C code and properly document your solution.

Add docstrings to your Python code.
